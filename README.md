# CoinEx Promo Codes and Latest CoinEx Trading Fee Discount Deals for 2026

## CoinEx Introduction

CoinEx is a global cryptocurrency exchange that's been making waves since 2017. Founded by Haipo Yang and launched by the industry-leading mining pool ViaBTC, this platform has grown into something pretty special over the past eight years.

What makes CoinEx stand out? Well, they were one of the first exchanges to actually show you their proof-of-reserves. Since 2022, they've been publishing this data monthly—complete with on-chain information and Merkle-tree proofs. You can verify everything yourself, which is refreshing in an industry where trust matters.

The numbers tell their own story. CoinEx now serves over 10 million users across more than 200 countries and regions. The platform supports 18 languages and offers access to over 1,400 cryptocurrencies with more than 1,900 trading pairs. Whether you're hunting for mainstream coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, or XRP, or looking for smaller altcoins that aren't listed elsewhere, CoinEx has you covered.

Here's what you'll find on the platform: spot trading with a self-developed matching engine that can handle up to 10,000 transactions per second, futures trading with leverage up to 100x on major assets, margin trading for those who want extra buying power, and features like one-click swap, staking, savings products, and copy trading. They've also recently launched CoinEx Vault for enhanced security, OnChain for hybrid trading, and CoinEx Pay for everyday crypto payments.

One feature that privacy-conscious traders appreciate: you can trade without KYC verification up to a $10,000 daily withdrawal limit. That's pretty generous compared to most exchanges these days.

CoinEx earned recognition as one of the Top Crypto Exchanges of 2026 by U.Today, which speaks to their commitment to security, transparency, and user experience. The platform recently celebrated its 8th anniversary with the theme "Voyage"—a fitting metaphor for navigating the sometimes turbulent crypto seas.

## CoinEx Promo Codes

Looking for ways to save on trading fees? CoinEx offers several promotional codes and referral bonuses that can help reduce your costs.

**Current Referral Codes and Bonuses:**

The most commonly promoted referral code is **FYDAP**, which offers new users a welcome bonus structure. When you sign up with a referral code, you can earn up to $100 by completing simple newcomer tasks. The bonus is task-based, meaning you'll need to complete specific activities like making your first deposit, executing trades, or exploring different platform features.

**How Referral Rewards Work:**

When you register using a referral link or code, you become part of CoinEx's referral program. Both you and the person who referred you can earn rewards. The referrer receives up to 40% of the trading fees you generate, settled in CET (CoinEx Token) according to exchange rates. These rewards are allocated to accounts daily, though the actual arrival time might be delayed slightly.

Some important notes about the referral program:
- Referral codes must be used during the registration process
- Self-referral through multiple accounts is strictly prohibited
- Referral rewards typically last for 12 months for regular users
- To become an Ambassador with lifetime benefits, you need to meet specific requirements

**Fee Discount with CET:**

Beyond referral codes, you can reduce trading fees by holding CET, CoinEx's native token. Using CET to pay fees gives you an automatic 20% discount on trading commissions. This stacks with VIP-level discounts, potentially reducing your fees significantly.

**VIP Program:**

CoinEx operates a tiered VIP system based on 30-day trading volume and CET holdings. As you climb the VIP levels, your trading fees decrease:
- Standard users: 0.2% maker/taker (or 0.16% with CET deduction)
- Higher VIP levels: fees can drop as low as 0.08% for makers and 0.1% for takers at VIP 5

**8th Anniversary Promotions:**

To celebrate their 8th anniversary in December 2025, CoinEx launched special campaigns including:
- 8 days of social media missions with CET/USDT prizes
- Community activities with interactive games and rewards
- A chance to win luxury prizes including a Mediterranean Cruise Trip, MacBook Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and AirPods Max
- Anniversary trading reports with personalized "trading sailor personas"

## CoinEx Reviews

CoinEx has received mixed reviews from users across various platforms, reflecting both strengths and areas for improvement.

**Positive Feedback:**

Users consistently praise CoinEx for its reliability during high market volatility. When other major exchanges experience downtime during market crashes or corrections, CoinEx tends to function smoothly—a crucial feature that traders appreciate. The platform's extensive selection of over 1,400 cryptocurrencies is another highlight, with many users coming specifically to access smaller altcoins not listed on other exchanges.

The user interface receives positive mentions for being clean, intuitive, and beginner-friendly. The one-click swap feature makes it easy for newcomers to convert between cryptocurrencies without navigating complex trading interfaces. More experienced traders appreciate the comprehensive tools, including futures with up to 100x leverage, copy trading options, and the demo mode for risk-free practice.

The fee structure is generally considered competitive, especially when using CET tokens for an additional 20% discount. Several reviewers highlighted the straightforward VIP tier system, which has lower requirements compared to many competitors.

Privacy-conscious users particularly value the option to trade without KYC verification up to $10,000 daily withdrawals—a feature that's becoming increasingly rare among major exchanges.

**Areas of Concern:**

Customer support comes up frequently in negative reviews. Some users report slow response times and generic replies that don't address their specific issues. For users facing withdrawal problems or account verification difficulties, this has proven frustrating.

During peak trading times, some users have experienced platform performance issues, though these reports are less common than positive reliability mentions. A few traders noted that liquidity on smaller altcoin pairs can be thin compared to larger exchanges like Binance.

The 2023 hot wallet hack resulted in an estimated $70 million loss, though CoinEx reimbursed all affected users and no customer funds were ultimately lost. The exchange was upfront about the incident and implemented enhanced security measures afterward. The platform now stores the vast majority of user assets in cold wallets with multi-signature protocols.

**Overall Ratings:**

- Google Play: 4.7/5 stars (based on 90,000+ reviews)
- iOS App Store: 4.2/5 stars (based on 52 reviews)
- Trustpilot: Mixed ratings with both strong supporters and critics
- Industry Recognition: Named Top Crypto Exchange of 2026 by U.Today

**User Testimonials:**

"I'm using CoinEx for the past 10 months. While market crash/correction all top exchanges stop working but CoinEx functions smoothly which is very important that an exchange should provide to its users."

"CoinEx is a decent crypto exchange for beginners. The interface is familiar to anyone who previously used another crypto exchange, and features most traders care about are easily accessible."

"The exchange has an enormously comprehensive help center with hundreds of educational articles and content."
